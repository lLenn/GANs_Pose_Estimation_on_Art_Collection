abstract = {Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.}

  abstract="Model-based pose estimation algorithms aim at recovering human motion from one or more camera views and a 3D model representation of the human body. The model pose is usually parameterized with a kinematic chain and thereby the pose is represented by a vector of joint angles. The majority of algorithms are based on minimizing an error function that measures how well the 3D model fits the image. This category of algorithms usually has two main stages, namely defining the model and fitting the model to image observations. In the first section, the reader is introduced to the different kinematic parametrization of human motion. In the second section, the most commonly used representations of the human shape are described. The third section is dedicated to the description of different error functions proposed in the literature and to common optimization techniques used for human pose estimation. Specifically, local optimization and particle-based optimization and filtering are discussed and compared. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the state-of-the-art in model-based pose estimation, current limitations and future directions.",

  abstract="State-of-the-art approaches for articulated human pose estimation are rooted in parts-based graphical models. These models are often restricted to tree-structured representations and simple parametric potentials in order to enable tractable inference. However, these simple dependencies fail to capture all the interactions between body parts. While models with more complex interactions can be defined, learning the parameters of these models remains challenging with intractable or approximate inference. In this paper, instead of performing inference on a learned graphical model, we build upon the inference machine framework and present a method for articulated human pose estimation. Our approach incorporates rich spatial interactions among multiple parts and information across parts of different scales. Additionally, the modular framework of our approach enables both ease of implementation without specialized optimization solvers, and efficient inference. We analyze our approach on two challenging datasets with large pose variation and outperform the state-of-the-art on these benchmarks.",
