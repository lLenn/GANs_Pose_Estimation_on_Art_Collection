\chapter{Improving Pose Estimation with Style Transfer}
\label{chap:improvements}
Having established a baseline, it is now possible to search for improvements.
In this chapter, 2 techniques will be explored to see if they can improve \gls{HPE}.
Using the same algorithms as seen in the previous chapter, they will now be used to
(1) transform an input artistic image to a photographic image to estimate poses on or
(2) be trained with a dataset that is augmented with images that are transformed to different styles.

\section{Pose Estimation after Style Transform}
This section will discuss (1)

\section{Augmenting COCO Dataset for Pose Estimation Training}
This section will discuss (2)
