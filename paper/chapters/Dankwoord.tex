\chapter*{Preface}

I've been interested in Art my entire life. In fact, I've a degree in the Fine Arts from LUCA School of Arts.
There, I was known for my technological ability and one of my professors at the time asked me why I didn't do anything with that in my artworks.
That remark has since stuck with me and was part of my motivation to apply for readmission for my Master of Science.
With all the advancements in AI, I started thinking more and more about doing work with that.
Like Matisse and Turner, I'm not satisfied with the tools available, but want to create my own.

It was therefor to my delight that I was able to work on this thesis which has provided me the opportunity to acquire more insight in the subject.
I would like to thank my supervisors Dieter De Witte and Steven Verstockt for this wonderful opportunity,
and my counsellor Kenzo Milleville for his great guidance. As well as all the other people at IDLab for their feedback.
I also want to thank Karine Lacaracina, Lies Van De Cappelle and the other people at RMFAB for providing help with the artistic sensibilities of the thesis.
