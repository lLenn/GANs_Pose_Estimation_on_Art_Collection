\chapter{Evaluation in the Wild}
This chapter will run the algorithms on the Art Collection from \gls{RMFAB}
as well as some that didn't qualify, but of which the results on a small dataset is still interesting.
From the Art Collection a set of images is chosen that have the highest rate of failure.
These include images with overlapping persons, occlusion, deformation, ...

\section{RMFAB Dataset}
What choices were made to establish the RMFAB dataset

\section{Tests}

Explanation of what tests were run
UGATIT was adapted to randomize the B image in the dataset.
We use the unaligned dataset from CycleGAN to do this

\section{Results}
What are the results from the tests
